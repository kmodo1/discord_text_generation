# Markov Chain Text Generation for Discord Messages

I wrote this code sometime during the summer of 2022, just to see what it would put out. If you want to run this code yourself, download your data from discord (Settings -> Privacy & Safety -> Request all of my data) and grab the discord_data/messages folder and put in the same folder as this. Then run `collectdata.py` and then `markov_chain_generation.py`.

## Crediting
While this code was written a while ago, I think that [this](https://dev.to/strikingloo/markov-chains-training-ai-to-write-game-of-thrones-25d6) was the source I used for much of the markov chain coding.
